            <h1  class="center1"><strong>Early Life and Work</strong></h1>
            <p class="center"><strong>O'Connor was involved with music from a young age. At age five, O'Connor was a part of the choir at the school where his mother worked.[4] He became a drummer and later taught himself piano. He started his music journey at Frensham Heights School in Farnham, Surrey.</strong></p>
            <h1  class="center1"><strong>Career</strong></h1>
            <p  class="center">In 2015, Rex Orange County self-released Bcos U Will Never B Free on SoundCloud.[2] This put him on musician Two Inch Punch's radar, who provided him with a management team. The two also collaborated on a few songsâ€”"UNO", "Best Friend", and "Untitled". This also caught Tyler, the Creator's attention. He sent him an email, appreciating the album, and he also flew him out to L.A. to work on Flower Boy.[5] Rex Orange County shared online the DIY "UNO" recording in 2016 when he was 18. Clash magazine wrote, "The buoyant keyboard riff underpins a hypnotic half-spoken vocal, one that veers from topic to topic in a hazy burst of creative mania."[6] In 2017, he released his second album Apricot Princess.[7] Three months after the release of his second album, Rex Orange County was featured on Tyler, the Creator's album Flower Boy; he co-wrote and contributed vocals to the songs "Boredom" and "Foreword".[7] His work has been compared to "other artsy, post-genre teen artists".[8]</p>
